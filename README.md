## About Get Nailed with Dany
Get Nailed with Dany is a web application targeted at Amsterdam-based individuals who are interested in getting nail design services. As a full-stack framework web application, it uses Django, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a B2C (Business to Customer) designed to create better user experience to clients and provide useful management tools for the business owner.

## UX/UI
Using core Design Thinking methods and Agile practices principles the strategy for this web application takes into consideration 2 personas: Business Owner and Client, and their respective problem statements. 

### Personas


#### Persona 1 (Business Owner)

Danyelle Maya, 24, Nail Designer, Single

- Brazilian living in Amsterdam – Immigrant in a new country
- Started her own business as a Nail Designer in her own home – Entrepreneurial mindset
- Only speaks Portuguese – learning English and Dutch – Limited communication in the Netherlands

Danielle is currently trying to grow her business but the lack of English knowledge makes so that she is limited to serving only Portuguese speaking clients. She wants to professionalize her services. Currently she does her bookings through WhatsApp messages. 

- Danielle has a good number of fixed Brazilian customers
- Danielle works from 9am to 6pm with short breaks in between clients
- Danielle’s work is popular on Instagram and social media


#### Persona 2 (Client)

Louise Smith, 31, Real Estate Agent, Married

- British living in Amsterdam for 7 years with her Dutch partner and 3 years old one son
- Works 32h per week and drives around the city to different locations throughout the day
- Speaks English and Dutch – Good communication skills in the Netherlands

Louise lives a busy life as a Real Estate Agent and mother. Her job requires her to present herself a certain way, she feels pressured to dress formal and have her hair and nails always done to provide a good first impression to her clients. Sometimes Louise needs to bring her son with her to appointments during the day – especially on weekends she has to work. 

- On her free time Louise goes to the Gym and spends time with her family
- Louise’s work schedule is hectic and unpredictable, sometimes with late work hours and other times with big empty windows between appointments.

### Problem Statements

- Problem Statement: Danielle Maya (Business Owner)	

I am a nail designer trying to expand my business to a diverse group of clients but I don’t have the time to answer to all of the booking request messages and calls I get on a day because I work from 9am to 6pm with limited breaks in between which makes me feel like I can’t give the needed attention to my clients so my business will never grow.	

- Problem Statement: Louise Smith

I am a real estate agent trying to book easy and flexible beauty services for myself but I don’t have the time to call different saloons to check if they have availibility because I am a mother with unpredictable working hours which makes me feel like if I don’t get to easily make appointments for getting my nails done, I will have to go to work with un-done nails and I won’t be taken seriously in my job. 


### User Stories

All user stories are documented with their respective acceptance criteria, story points and MoSCoW prioritization on [my Github Issues](https://github.com/anabramos/getnailedwithdany/issues)

### Agile Practices

#### Wireframes
- All wireframes were designed with Balsamiq tool. 

#### Product Backlog & Project Board
- I created my product backlog using [my Github Milestones](https://github.com/anabramos/getnailedwithdany/milestones), dividing story points more or less euqaly per iteration. This however did not translate the build up order of the project, as I had overestimated how some tasks and features are dependant from others to being build.  
- For information radiators I have made use of [my Github Projects](https://github.com/anabramos/getnailedwithdany/projects/1)
