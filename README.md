Louise Smith, 31, Real Estate Agent, Married

- British living in Amsterdam for 7 years with her Dutch partner and 3 years old one son
- Works 32h per week and drives around the city to different locations throughout the day
- Speaks English and Dutch – Good communication skills in the Netherlands

Louise lives a busy life as a Real Estate Agent and mother. Her job requires her to present herself a certain way, she feels pressured to dress formal and have her hair and nails always done to provide a good first impression to her clients. Sometimes Louise needs to bring her son with her to appointments during the day – especially on weekends she has to work. 

- On her free time Louise goes to the Gym and spends time with her family
- Louise’s work schedule is hectic and unpredictable, sometimes with late work hours and other times with big empty windows between appointments.

### Problem Statements

- Problem Statement: Danielle Maya	
I am a nail designer trying to expand my business to a diverse group of clients but I don’t have the time to answer to all of the booking request messages I get on a day because I work from 9am to 6pm with limited breaks in between which makes me feel like I can’t give the needed attention to my clients so my business will never grow.	

- Problem Statement: Louise Smith
I am a real estate agent trying to book easy and flexible beauty services for myself but I don’t have the time to call different saloons because I am a mother with unpredictable working hours  which makes me feel like if I don’t get to get my hair and nails don’t I won’t be taken seriously in my job.
